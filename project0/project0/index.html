          <p>Hampshire Cricket, on Thursday (April 10) announced that it has cancelled its contract with Nathan Lyon for the upcoming season of County Championship.
          The Australian offspinner was set to join the club for a significant part of the 2020 Championship season. <br>However, with all the English domestic fixtures getting cancelled till May 28 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was mutually decided that Lyon will not play for the club this season.
        Giles White, Hampshire's Director Of Cricket, said, "These are obviously very uncertain and challenging times, and it's clear the issues cricket currently faces will contribute to the way in which counties are able to operate and prepare for this season.<br>As a result of this and following conversations with Nathan and his management, it was mutually agreed that he would no longer join us this season.
      I would like to thank Nathan and his representatives for their complete understanding and agreement and we hope to welcome him to the club next season."
    Lyon joins Cheteshwar Pujara (Gloucestershire) and Michael Neser (Surrey) as third other overseas player in the Championship to have his contract cancelled for the upcoming season.
